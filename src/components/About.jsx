                <p className="text-justify">
                    I'm a dedicated backend engineer with extensive expertise in Java and modern software development practices.
                    While my primary focus is crafting robust, efficient, and scalable backend solutions, I also actively support
                    frontend development, leveraging technologies like React and JavaScript to create intuitive user experiences.
                    I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science (Research Stream) from a prestigious Canadian university,
                    where I conducted thesis research using a mixed model of algebraic and logical software validation for
                    real-time systems.

                    My professional journey includes valuable experience as a professional software
                    engineer at ECR and a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science, where I simplified intricate technical
                    concepts, empowering students and nurturing their passion for technology. Beyond my coding responsibilities
                    and academic experiences, I'm deeply interested in researching emerging technologies, exploring industry trends,
                    and sharing insights into current and impactful IT innovations through storytelling. My goal remains steadfast:
                    bridging technology and creativity to build seamless, dynamic digital experiences.
