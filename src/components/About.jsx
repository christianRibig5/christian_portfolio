                <h2 className="text-center">About Me</h2>
                <p className="text-justify">I'm a DevOps Engineer and Cloud Specialist with a strong academic and professional foundation in computer science. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science (Thesis Stream) from Bishop’s University, Canada, where my research focused on algebraic and logical verification models for real-time reactive systems. My academic journey also includes a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, complemented by advanced DevOps training at Purdue University and Edureka. Professionally, I have progressed from backend-focused software engineering to driving automation, scalability, and reliability as a DevOps Engineer at ECR Technology Services. In this role, I designed CI/CD pipelines, automated infrastructure with Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, and Terraform, and implemented monitoring systems with Prometheus and Grafana, achieving measurable improvements in release speed, uptime, and operational efficiency. Passionate about bridging research and industry, I am committed to delivering innovative, resilient, and high-impact solutions in cloud-native and distributed systems.
