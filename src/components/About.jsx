                <p className="text-justify">
                    I'm a backend engineer specializing in Java and modern software development.
                    While I focus on building scalable backend systems, I also support frontend
                    projects using Java and JavaScript frameworks. I hold a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science
                    (thesis Stream) from a Canadian university, where I explored algebraic and
                    logical validation models for real-time systems.

                <p className="text-justify">
                    My experience includes working as a software engineer at ECR and lecturing in
                    the Department of Computer Science. I'm passionate about emerging tech, research,
                    and translating complex ideas into meaningful digital solutions.
