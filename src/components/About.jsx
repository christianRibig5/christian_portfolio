                <p className="text-justify">
                    I’m a backend engineer with hands-on experience in Java, Python, JavaScript, modern software development,
                    and DevOps practices using Docker and related infrastructure. While my core focus is on building scalable
                    backend systems, I also contribute to frontend projects using Java and JavaScript frameworks.<br />
                    I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science (Thesis Stream) from Bishop’s University, Quebec,
                    where my research focused on algebraic and logical validation models for real-time systems.<br />
                    My experience includes working as a software engineer at ECR Technologies and lecturing in the Department of
                    Computer Science. I'm passionate about emerging technologies, research, and turning complex concepts into
                    meaningful digital solutions.
