                <p className="text-justify">
                    I’m a backend-focused Full-Stack and DevOps Engineer with practical experience in Java,
                    Python, JavaScript, and modern cloud-native development. My expertise spans building scalable backend
                    systems, automating infrastructure with Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines, and contributing
                    to frontend projects using Java and JavaScript frameworks. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science (Thesis Stream)
                    from Bishop’s University, Quebec, where my research explored algebraic and logical validation models for
                    real-time systems. My background includes roles as a Software and DevOps  Engineer at ECR Technology Services and a Lecturer
                    in the Department of Computer Science. I'm passionate about solving complex problems, advancing software
                    reliability, and delivering end-to-end digital solutions that are both efficient and impactful.
