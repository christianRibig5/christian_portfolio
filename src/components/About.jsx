                <h2 className="text-center">About Me</h2>
                <p className="text-justify">I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science (Thesis Stream) from Bishop’s University, Canada, where my research focused on <a href="https://www.ubishops.ca/wp-content/uploads/onyeukwu20241210.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">algebraic and logical verification models for real-time reactive systems </a>,. My academic journey also includes a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, complemented by advanced DevOps training at Purdue University and Edureka. Professionally, I have progressed from backend-focused software engineering to driving automation, scalability, and reliability as a DevOps Engineer at ECR Technology Services. In this role, I designed CI/CD pipelines, automated infrastructure with Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, and Terraform, and implemented monitoring systems with Prometheus and Grafana, achieving measurable improvements in release speed, uptime, and operational efficiency.
                    Beyond industry, I have contributed to academic research, authoring and co-authoring
                    publications such as <a href="https://www.longdom.org/open-access/the-effects-of-modified-relu-activation-functions-in-image-classification-94927.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The effects of modified ReLU activation functions in image classification (Journal of Biomedical Engineering and Medical Devices, 2022)</a>, <a href="https://www.jisem-journal.com/index.php/journal/article/view/12504" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can bus data analysis for anomaly detection in connected and automated vehicles (JISEM, 2025)</a>, and <a href="https://www.jisem-journal.com/index.php/journal/article/view/12656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hybrid BPSO-XGBoost framework for anomaly detection in connected and automated vehicles (JISEM, 2025)</a>. Passionate about bridging research and industry, I am committed to delivering innovative, resilient, and high-impact solutions in cloud-native and distributed systems.
